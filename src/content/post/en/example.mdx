## Overview

Navigating the inner workings of _Techfolio_ might seem like a daunting task, especially when it comes to its various usage points.

This section aims to elucidate and simplify some of the methodologies inherent in _Techfolio_. Consider it a roadmap for further customization or a manual for integrating techniques into your own projects.

## Language

Presently, _Techfolio_ extends support to just two languages: English and Spanish. However, expanding its linguistic horizons is a straightforward endeavor with the following configuration steps:

- **Configuration File (src/config.yml):** This pivotal file serves as the nucleus of the Techfolio template. Within its confines, you wield the power to toggle and tweak site settings. Here, you can effortlessly activate or deactivate project, blog, and store features. Additionally, language augmentation is seamlessly integrated into the template structure.

- **Internationalization (src/i18n):** Delve into this directory to unearth the translations of the user interface. To harness the full potential of your preferred language, meticulous translation of every text fragment within the files is imperative. Furthermore, you must import the file into utils.tsx and append the requisite case inside the switch in the useTranslations function.

- **Content Management:** Your portfolio's essence is encapsulated within MDX files residing in the content folder. Refer to the schemas outlined in the config.ts file to craft the data that will grace your portfolio's display.

## Content

The fabric of your portfolio is woven using MDX, nestled snugly within the pre-configured files housed in the content directory. Referencing the schemas delineated in the config.ts file, here you sculpt the substance that will adorn your portfolio.

## Deployment

While my personal preference leans towards Cloudflare hosting, deploying _Techfolio_ is a breeze on Netlify, ensuring swift and hassle-free setup.
